			<P>BitTorrent is a protocol for distributing files. It identifies content by URL 
				and is designed to integrate seamlessly with the web. Its advantage over plain 
				HTTP is that when multiple downloads of the same file happen concurrently, the 
				downloaders upload to each other, making it possible for the file source to 
				support very large numbers of downloaders with only a modest increase in its 
				load.</P>
			<P>A BitTorrent file distribution consists of these entities:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				An ordinary web server
				<LI>
				A static 'metainfo' file
				<LI>
				A BitTorrent tracker
				<LI>
				An 'original' downloader
				<LI>
				The end user web browsers
				<LI>
					The end user downloaders
				</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>There are ideally many end users for a single file.</P>
			<P>To start serving, a host goes through the following steps:</P>
			<OL>
				<LI>
				Start running a tracker (or, more likely, have one running already).
				<LI>
				Start running an ordinary web server, such as apache, or have one already.
				<LI>
					Associate the extension <CODE>.torrent</CODE> with mimetype <CODE>application/x-bittorrent</CODE>
				on their web server (or have done so already).
				<LI>
				Generate a metainfo (.torrent) file using the complete file to be served and 
				the URL of the tracker.
				<LI>
				Put the metainfo file on the web server.
				<LI>
				Link to the metainfo (.torrent) file from some other web page.
				<LI>
					Start a downloader which already has the complete file (the 'origin').
				</LI>
			</OL>
			<P>To start downloading, a user does the following:</P>
			<OL>
				<LI>
				Install BitTorrent (or have done so already).
				<LI>
				Surf the web.
				<LI>
				Click on a link to a .torrent file.
				<LI>
				Select where to save the file locally, or select a partial download to resume.
				<LI>
				Wait for download to complete.
				<LI>
					Tell downloader to exit (it keeps uploading until this happens).
				</LI>
			</OL>
			<P>The connectivity is as follows:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				The web site is serving up static files as normal, but kicking off the 
				BitTorrent helper app on the clients.
				<LI>
				The tracker is receiving information from all downloaders and giving them 
				random lists of peers. This is done over HTTP or HTTPS.
				<LI>
				Downloaders are periodically checking in with the tracker to keep it informed 
				of their progress, and are uploading to and downloading from each other via 
				direct connections. These connections use the BitTorrent peer protocol, which 
				operates over TCP.
				<LI>
					The origin is uploading but not downloading at all, since it has the entire 
					file. The origin is necessary to get the entire file into the network. Often 
					for popular downloads the origin can be taken down after a while since several 
					downloads may have completed and been left running indefinitely.
				</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>Metainfo file and tracker responses are both sent in a simple, efficient, and 
				extensible format called bencoding (pronounced 'bee encoding'). Bencoded 
				messages are nested dictionaries and lists (as in Python), which can contain 
				strings and integers. Extensibility is supported by ignoring unexpected 
				dictionary keys, so additional optional ones can be added later.</P>
			<P>Bencoding is done as follows:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					Strings are length-prefixed base ten followed by a colon and the string. For 
					example <CODE>4:spam</CODE>
				corresponds to 'spam'.
				<LI>
					Integers are represented by an 'i' followed by the number in base 10 followed 
					by an 'e'. For example <CODE>i3e</CODE> corresponds to 3 and <CODE>i-3e</CODE> corresponds 
					to -3. Integers have no size limitation. <CODE>i-0e</CODE> is invalid. All 
					encodings with a leading zero, such as <CODE>i03e</CODE>, are invalid, other 
					than <CODE>i0e</CODE>, which of course corresponds to 0.
				<LI>
					Lists are encoded as an 'l' followed by their elements (also bencoded) followed 
					by an 'e'. For example <CODE>l4:spam4:eggse</CODE>
				corresponds to ['spam', 'eggs'].
				<LI>
					Dictionaries are encoded as a 'd' followed by a list of alternating keys and 
					their corresponding values followed by an 'e'. For example, <CODE>d3:cow3:moo4:spam4:eggse</CODE>
					corresponds to {'cow': 'moo', 'spam': 'eggs'} and <CODE>d4:spaml1:a1:bee</CODE> 
					corresponds to {'spam': ['a', 'b']} . Keys must be strings and appear in sorted 
					order (sorted as raw strings, not alphanumerics).
				</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>Metainfo files are bencoded dictionaries with the following keys:</P>
			<DL>
				<DT><CODE>announce</CODE>
					<DD>
						<P>The URL of the tracker.</P>
						<DT><CODE>info</CODE>
							<DD>
								<P>This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below.</P>
								<P>The <CODE>name</CODE> key maps to a string which is the suggested name to save 
									the file (or directory) as. It is purely advisory.</P>
								<P><CODE>piece length</CODE> maps to the number of bytes in each piece the file is 
									split into. For the purposes of transfer, files are split into fixed-size 
									pieces which are all the same length except for possibly the last one which may 
									be truncated. Piece length is almost always a power of two, most commonly 2<SUP>18</SUP>
									= 256 K (BitTorrent prior to version 3.2 uses 2<SUP>20</SUP> = 1 M as default).</P>
								<P><CODE>pieces</CODE> maps to a string whose length is a multiple of 20. It is to 
									be subdivided into strings of length 20, each of which is the SHA1 hash of the 
									piece at the corresponding index.</P>
								<P>There is also a key <CODE>length</CODE> or a key <CODE>files</CODE>, but not 
									both or neither. If <CODE>length</CODE> is present then the download represents 
									a single file, otherwise it represents a set of files which go in a directory 
									structure.</P>
								<P>In the single file case, <CODE>length</CODE> maps to the length of the file in 
									bytes.</P>
								<P>For the purposes of the other keys, the multi-file case is treated as only 
									having a single file by concatenating the files in the order they appear in the 
									files list. The files list is the value <CODE>files</CODE> maps to, and is a 
									list of dictionaries containing the following keys:</P>
								<DL>
									<DT><CODE>length</CODE>
										<DD>
											The length of the file, in bytes. <DT><CODE>path</CODE>
												<DD>
													A list of strings corresponding to subdirectory names, the last of which is the 
													actual file name (a zero length list is an error case).
												</DD>
								</DL>
								<P>In the single file case, the <CODE>name</CODE> key is the name of a file, in the 
									muliple file case, it's the name of a directory.</P>
							</DD>
			</DL>
			<P>Tracker queries are two way. The tracker receives information via HTTP GET 
				parameters and returns a bencoded message. Note that although the current 
				tracker implementation has its own web server, the tracker could run very 
				nicely as, for example, an apache module.</P>
			<P>Tracker GET requests have the following keys:</P>
			<DL>
				<DT><CODE>info_hash</CODE>
					<DD>
						<P>The 20 byte sha1 hash of the bencoded form of the <CODE>info</CODE> value from 
							the metainfo file. Note that this is a substring of the metainfo file. This 
							value will almost certainly have to be escaped.</P>
						<DT><CODE>peer_id</CODE>
							<DD>
								<P>A string of length 20 which this downloader uses as its id. Each downloader 
									generates its own id at random at the start of a new download. This value will 
									also almost certainly have to be escaped.</P>
								<DT><CODE>ip</CODE>
									<DD>
										<P>An optional parameter giving the IP (or dns name) which this peer is at. 
											Generally used for the origin if it's on the same machine as the tracker.</P>
										<DT><CODE>port</CODE>
											<DD>
												<P>The port number this peer is listening on. Common behavior is for a downloader 
													to try to listen on port 6881 and if that port is taken try 6882, then 6883, 
													etc. and give up after 6889.</P>
												<DT><CODE>uploaded</CODE>
													<DD>
														<P>The total amount uploaded so far, encoded in base ten ascii.</P>
														<DT><CODE>downloaded</CODE>
															<DD>
																<P>The total amount downloaded so far, encoded in base ten ascii.</P>
																<DT><CODE>left</CODE>
																	<DD>
																		<P>The number of bytes this peer still has to download, encoded in base ten ascii. 
																			Note that this can't be computed from downloaded and the file length since it 
																			might be a resume, and there's a chance that some of the downloaded data failed 
																			an integrity check and had to be re-downloaded.</P>
																		<DT><CODE>event</CODE>
																			<DD>
																				<P>This is an optional key which maps to <CODE>started</CODE>, <CODE>completed</CODE>, 
																					or <CODE>stopped</CODE> (or empty, which is the same as not being present). If 
																					not present, this is one of the announcements done at regular intervals. An 
																					announcement using <CODE>started</CODE> is sent when a download first begins, 
																					and one using <CODE>completed</CODE> is sent when the download is complete. No <CODE>
																						completed</CODE> is sent if the file was complete when started. Downloaders 
																					send an announcement using 'stopped' when they cease downloading.</P>
																			</DD>
			</DL>
			<P>Tracker responses are bencoded dictionaries. If a tracker response has a key <CODE>failure 
					reason</CODE>, then that maps to a human readable string which explains why 
				the query failed, and no other keys are required. Otherwise, it must have two 
				keys: <CODE>interval</CODE>, which maps to the number of seconds the downloader 
				should wait between regular rerequests, and <CODE>peers</CODE>. <CODE>peers</CODE>
				maps to a list of dictionaries corresponding to peers, each of which contains 
				the keys <CODE>peer id</CODE>, <CODE>ip</CODE>, and <CODE>port</CODE>, which 
				map to the peer's self-selected ID, IP address or dns name as a string, and 
				port number, respectively. Note that downloaders may rerequest on nonscheduled 
				times if an event happens or they need more peers.</P>
			<P>If you want to make any extensions to metainfo files or tracker queries, please 
				coordinate with Bram Cohen to make sure that all extensions are done 
				compatibly.</P>
			<P>BitTorrent's peer protocol operates over TCP. It performs efficiently without 
				setting any socket options.</P>
			<P>Peer connections are symmetrical. Messages sent in both directions look the 
				same, and data can flow in either direction.</P>
			<P>The peer protocol refers to pieces of the file by index as described in the 
				metainfo file, starting at zero. When a peer finishes downloading a piece and 
				checks that the hash matches, it announces that it has that piece to all of its 
				peers.</P>
			<P>Connections contain two bits of state on either end: choked or not, and 
				interested or not. Choking is a notification that no data will be sent until 
				unchoking happens. The reasoning and common techniques behind choking are 
				explained later in this document.</P>
			<P>Data transfer takes place whenever one side is interested and the other side is 
				not choking. Interest state must be kept up to date at all times - whenever a 
				downloader doesn't have something they currently would ask a peer for in 
				unchoked, they must express lack of interest, despite being choked. 
				Implementing this properly is tricky, but makes it possible for downloaders to 
				know which peers will start downloading immediately if unchoked.</P>
			<P>Connections start out choked and not interested.</P>
			<P>When data is being transferred, downloaders should keep several piece requests 
				queued up at once in order to get good TCP performance (this is called 
				'pipelining'.) On the other side, requests which can't be written out to the 
				TCP buffer immediately should be queued up in memory rather than kept in an 
				application-level network buffer, so they can all be thrown out when a choke 
				happens.</P>
			<P>The peer wire protocol consists of a handshake followed by a never-ending stream 
				of length-prefixed messages. The handshake starts with character ninteen 
				(decimal) followed by the string 'BitTorrent protocol'. The leading character 
				is a length prefix, put there in the hope that other new protocols may do the 
				same and thus be trivially distinguishable from each other.</P>
			<P>All later integers sent in the protocol are encoded as four bytes big-endian.</P>
			<P>After the fixed headers come eight reserved bytes, which are all zero in all 
				current implementations. If you wish to extend the protocol using these bytes, 
				please coordinate with Bram Cohen to make sure all extensions are done 
				compatibly.</P>
			<P>Next comes the 20 byte sha1 hash of the bencoded form of the <CODE>info</CODE> value 
				from the metainfo file. (This is the same value which is announced as info_hash 
				to the tracker, only here it's raw instead of quoted here). If both sides don't 
				send the same value, they sever the connection. The one possible exception is 
				if a downloader wants to do multiple downloads over a single port, they may 
				wait for incoming connections to give a download hash first, and respond with 
				the same one if it's in their list.</P>
			<P>After the download hash comes the 20-byte peer id which is reported in tracker 
				requests and contained in peer lists in tracker responses. If the receiving 
				side's peer id doesn't match the one the initiating side expects, it severs the 
				connection.</P>
			<P>That's it for handshaking, next comes an alternating stream of length prefixes 
				and messages. Messages of length zero are keepalives, and ignored. Keepalives 
				are generally sent once every two minutes, but note that timeouts can be done 
				much more quickly when data is expected.</P>
			<P>All non-keepalive messages start with a single byte which gives their type. The 
				possible values are:</P>
			<UL>
				<LI>
				0 - choke
				<LI>
				1 - unchoke
				<LI>
				2 - interested
				<LI>
				3 - not interested
				<LI>
				4 - have
				<LI>
				5 - bitfield
				<LI>
				6 - request
				<LI>
				7 - piece
				<LI>
					8 - cancel
				</LI>
			</UL>
			<P>'choke', 'unchoke', 'interested', and 'not interested' have no payload.</P>
			<P>'bitfield' is only ever sent as the first message. Its payload is a bitfield 
				with each index that downloader has sent set to one and the rest set to zero. 
				Downloaders which don't have anything yet may skip the 'bitfield' message. The 
				first byte of the bitfield corresponds to indices 0 - 7 from high bit to low 
				bit, respectively. The next one 8-15, etc. Spare bits at the end are set to 
				zero.</P>
			<P>The 'have' message's payload is a single number, the index which that downloader 
				just completed and checked the hash of.</P>
			<P>'request' messages contain an index, begin, and length. The last two are byte 
				offsets. Length is generally a power of two unless it gets truncated by the end 
				of the file. All current implementations use 2<SUP>15</SUP>, and close 
				connections which request an amount greater than 2<SUP>17</SUP>.</P>
			<P>'cancel' messages have the same payload as request messages. They are generally 
				only sent towards the end of a download, during what's called 'endgame mode'. 
				When a download is almost complete, there's a tendency for the last few pieces 
				to all be downloaded off a single hosed modem line, taking a very long time. To 
				make sure the last few pieces come in quickly, once requests for all pieces a 
				given downloader doesn't have yet are currently pending, it sends requests for 
				everything to everyone it's downloading from. To keep this from becoming 
				horribly inefficient, it sends cancels to everyone else every time a piece 
				arrives.</P>
			<P>'piece' messages contain an index, begin, and piece. Note that they are 
				correlated with request messages implicitly. It's possible for an unexpected 
				piece to arrive if choke and unchoke messages are sent in quick succession 
				and/or transfer is going very slowly.</P>
			<P>Downloaders generally download pieces in random order, which does a reasonably 
				good job of keeping them from having a strict subset or superset of the pieces 
				of any of their peers.</P>
			<P>Choking is done for several reasons. TCP congestion control behaves very poorly 
				when sending over many connections at once. Also, choking lets each peer use a 
				tit-for-tat-ish algorithm to ensure that they get a consistent download rate.</P>
			<P>The choking algorithm described below is the currently deployed one. It is very 
				important that all new algorithms work well both in a network consisting 
				entirely of themselves and in a network consisting mostly of this one.</P>
			<P>There are several criteria a good choking algorithm should meet. It should cap 
				the number of simultaneous uploads for good TCP performance. It should avoid 
				choking and unchoking quickly, known as 'fibrillation'. It should reciprocate 
				to peers who let it download. Finally, it should try out unused connections 
				once in a while to find out if they might be better than the currently used 
				ones, known as optimistic unchoking.</P>
			<P>The currently deployed choking algorithm avoids fibrillation by only changing 
				who's choked once every ten seconds. It does reciprocation and number of 
				uploads capping by unchoking the four peers which it has the best download 
				rates from and are interested. Peers which have a better upload rate but aren't 
				interested get unchoked and if they become interested the worst uploader gets 
				choked. If a downloader has a complete file, it uses its upload rate rather 
				than its download rate to decide who to unchoke.</P>
			<P>For optimistic unchoking, at any one time there is a single peer which is 
				unchoked regardless of it's upload rate (if interested, it counts as one of the 
				four allowed downloaders.) Which peer is optimistically unchoked rotates every 
				30 seconds. To give them a decent chance of getting a complete piece to upload, 
				new connections are three times as likely to start as the current optimistic 
				unchoke as anywhere else in the rotation.</P>
